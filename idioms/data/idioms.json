We know we are watching a fake play, but it is presented in a three-dimensional space, making use of cinematic techniques, and it feels as real as anything else in an Anderson film. But then everything comes to a head. Everyone is gathered in the crater, with a cardboard box over their head so that they can witness an astrological ellipsis - in which the sun, the moon, and the Milky Way line up along a single plane. Dr. Hickenlooper explains how it works: \"What you are going to see is a very simple dot, dot, dot.\" But after the three dots, a fourth appears, glowing green, and it grows closer until it becomes, clearly, a flying saucer. It hovers over the crater and sheds a green light over everything. A spindly extraterrestrial descends on the ceremony and departs with the meteor, leaving all the observers stunned. End of Act I.",

The contract for the building of a befitting secretariat was awarded in 2012 by the Dakingari administration at an initial cost of just over N3 billion. The project suffered some delays and some years after, the contractor asked for a review of the cost to about N7 billion. It dragged on until Nasir Idris became governor and inherited it. Its completion was one of the cardinal electioneering campaign promises of the governor. When he won, he went for it and asked the original contractor to make submissions of what it will take to complete it. To our chagrin, the contractors made a staggering costing of N21 billion. The government flatly rejected it and decided to revoke it. When the contracting company was announced government's intention to revoke the contract, it sat well with them. So, it was revoked and two reputable indigenous companies made a joint submission of N10 billion to complete it and the government, seeing the advantages, awarded the contract to them. We are talking about halving the cost and getting it finished in 18 months. So, it beats me how anybody would raise eyebrows or cry wolf where none exists.",
