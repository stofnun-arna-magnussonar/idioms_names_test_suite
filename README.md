# Idiomatic Expressions and Proper Names for English→Icelandic (WMT24 test suite submission)

This repo contains the submission of the Árni Magnússon Institute's team to the WMT24 test suite subtask, focusing on idiomatic expressions and proper names for the English→Icelandic translation direction.

Intuitively and empirically, idioms and proper names are known to be a significant challenge for modern translation models. We create two different test suites, described below.

## Idiomatic Expressions

The test suite in `idioms` evaluates the competency of MT systems in translating common English idiomatic expressions, as well as testing whether systems can distinguish between those expressions and the same phrases when used in a literal context. 

## Proper Names

The second test suite consists of place names that should be translated into their Icelandic exonyms (and correctly inflected) and pairs of Icelandic names that share a surface form between the male and female variants, so that incorrect translations impact meaning as well as readability.
